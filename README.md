## About Elixr
Elixr is a research and development project that will eventually become a web app that will change the way that people look and prepare for 'a good night out in the town.'

## Motivation for building this project.
This is my first personal project of mine and something that I had worked on for a long time.
Mainly I had always wanted to learn how to program and with the release of swift and me completing highschool has made this possible.
Also I want to break in on the market that companies that Yelp, Zomato and Foursquare are in.
It's time for something fresh.

## Due to significant API changes the backend for this app has been diabled but the code is still available to view.
This is a portfolio piece.
